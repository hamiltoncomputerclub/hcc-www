<html><body><p>In July 2015 I gave a talk on the Raspberry Pi at Hamilton Computer Club.



My last talk was February 2014 so it was long overdue for a new talk.



This talk on the Raspberry Pi was intended to be less tecniqal than the previous one.



For the slides I used the same format as my previous talk - svg. I used an addon in Inkscape called Sozi. It allows me to select objects in Inkscape and assign it to a slide. Once all the slides are complete the file is opened in a web browser.



I uploaded the file to my webserver wcmckee for the talk.



In terms of a computer to use for the talk I used a Raspberry Pi 2b running Raspbian. This was connected to the projecter via a hdml to vga cable.



The other program I demoed was Kodi (formally xbmc). For this I had to use a laptop running Fedora. Sadly I was down to one Pi and hadn't organised another with OpenELEC running.



I had my Chromebook running beside me during the talk with Google Hangouts recording my talk. This is the second time that I have recorded a talk.
