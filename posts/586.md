<a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/save-your-money-and-download-microsofts-free-ebooks-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://www.techrepublic.com/<wbr></wbr>article/save-your-money-and-<wbr></wbr>download-microsofts-free-<wbr></wbr>ebooks-on-windows-10/</a>

Not only is Microsoft giving away its new Windows 10 operating system for Free, the company is also giving away 100's of Free eBooks covering a wide range of Microsoft technologies-including Windows

10.Let's take a closer look.

As you may know, this isn't the first time Microsoft has made a collection of Microsoft eBooks available for Free.

Introducing Windows 10 for IT Professionals Preview Edition Written by Ed Bott for Microsoft Press, this eBook is a preview edition of the Introducing Windows 10 for IT Professionals book that

will be available for purchase soon after Windows 10 launches. As Bott notes in the eBook's introduction:

Even so, this 101-page eBook provides a terrific outline of the Windows 10 operating system's features and technologies in a generalized fashion. The books are listed on Eric Ligman's MSDN Blog. Ligman, who is a Microsoft Senior Sales Excellence Manager, has been posting blogs on his site since 2004 and more than once his posts have publicized collections of Free eBooks. This time around, the collection is the largest I've ever seen.

Are these time-bombed versions of the books?

No, the free versions of the resources are full-version and do not

have a time-out feature in them, so you can continue to use them for

as long as you choose.

3. “I work for a library, resource desk, etc. and would like to share

these with others. Is it ok to share your links to these?” (or some

flavor of this with different variations)

Absolutely. Please feel free to share the links to these

resources; however, please read #1 above on why you can share the

links, but don’t distribute the actual works themselves as an offline

resource. Please help support these fantastic authors and publishers

by downloading the latest versions directly from them.

<h1>Windows 10 will be available via USB flash drive or DVD</h1>

http://www.techrepublic.com/article/windows-10-will-be-available-via-usb-flash-drive-or-dvd/



Greg Shultz take a look at the possibility that Microsoft will be

selling retail copies of Windows 10 on USB flash drives.

As you may know, installing an operating system from a USB flash drive

is easier and faster than installing it from an optical disc. A USB

flash drive is not as bulky as an optical disc and doesn't require an

external case. You just take it out of your pocket, pull off the cap,

and insert it into your computer's USB port. USB flash drives are

faster than optical drives too. USB flash drives have read and write

speeds that measure in 10x megabytes per second (MB/s), while optical

disc read and write speeds measure in 1x MB/s.

With that in mind, it's no surprise that there are a multitude of

articles on the web that describe how to create a Windows installation

package on a USB flash drive. Microsoft even provides a tool that

facilitates the procedure.

With Windows 10 on the horizon, there have been rumors floating around

the web that in addition to making the upgrade available as a

download, Microsoft will also be selling the retail copies of the new

operating system on both DVD and USB flash drive.

Having a USB flash drive option makes sense, because tablets don't

come with optical disc drives.

<h1>Microsoft brings Windows 10 Edge browser in line with the competition</h1>

If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Microsoft brings Windows 10 Edge browser in line with the competition



With the release of Windows 10 on the horizon, Microsoft details the steps its taking to ensure its new Edge browser performs largely the same as Apple's Safari and Google's Chrome.



After years of trying to plow its own furrow with Internet Explorer (IE), Microsoft has said its new Edge browser will broadly behave like Apple Safari and Google Chrome.



Microsoft this week detailed how its Edge browser for Windows 10 will largely match how Safari and Chrome handle web sites and apps.



It follows years of Microsoft being attacked for Internet Explorer (IE) treating HTML, CSS and JavaScript differently to other major browsers - leading to quirks in how sites looked and behaved in IE.

<h1>What are the basic facts of the Windows 10 upgrade?</h1>

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-faq">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-faq</a>



Microsoft is making Windows 10 available as free upgrade for qualified Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows Phone 8.1 devices. It will be available starting July 29, 2015; people can reserve their free upgrade today.



You only have until July 29, 2016 to take advantage of this offer. Once you upgrade, you have Windows 10 for free on that device.



Are there any qualification requirements?



The only requirements are that a) your device is compatible, and b) youre running genuine Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) or Windows 8.1 (Update).
