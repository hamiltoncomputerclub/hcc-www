<h1>Help, hints, HOWTOs</h1>

<h2>Get a disposable email address from MailDrop | PCWorld</h2>

<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2043868/get-a-disposable-email-address-from-maildrop.html">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2043868/get-a-disposable-email-address-from-maildrop.html</a>



If you're registering online for some freebie, promotion, or Web site that you just know is going to deluge you with ads and other spam, it makes sense to supply a disposable address—something you can access as needed for confirmation messages or the like, but that won't otherwise interfere with your primary inbox.



MailDrop gives you a free throwaway email address. Use it in place of your own address, then head to the site to retrieve any messages you might need.

<h2>Get more out of Google Earth with these tips for power users | PCWorld</h2>

<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2042845/google-earth-power-user-tips.html#tk.rss_howto">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2042845/google-earth-power-user-tips.html</a>



Google Earth users can do more than just fly around a virtual globe. The free mapping application can display real-time weather, help compose photographs and measure distances much more easily than its Maps cousin.

<h2>How non-Dropbox users can send files to your Dropbox account | PCWorld</h2>

<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2046745/how-non-dropbox-users-can-send-files-to-your-dropbox-account.html#tk.rss_howto">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2046745/how-non-dropbox-users-can-send-files-to-your-dropbox-account.html</a>



What if someone wants to send a file to you via Dropbox? Unless they have Dropbox accounts of their own, they can't.



Now they can. Browser-based Dbinbox enables Dropbox sharing in the other direction: It generates a custom link that others can use to send files to your Dropbox.

<h2>How to clean and secure your browser like a pro | PCWorld</h2>

Take a minute to deep-clean the PC, eliminating unwanted browser toolbars, add-ons, extensions, and homepage- and search-hijacking malware.

<h2>How to delete or move a lot of Gmail messages | PCWorld</h2>

GMail lacks an obvious, simple tool for bulk operations. There's no button to click or menu option to select for deleting or altering all of the messages or conversations that share a specific attribute. But you can still do it.

It was after marvelling at some fed-up users' tweets about how incredibly difficult it is to delete a Skype account that a British developer named Robb Lewis decided to lend a hand.



So he built a website that takes the adventure out of account-deletion.



It's called Just Delete Me, and it's as simple as Skype's account-deletion procedure is convoluted.



1. Go to justdelete.me and find the service from which you want to delete your account.



2. Click on the service's name and follow the instructions on the screen to delete your account.

<h2>How to find a lost message in Gmail | PCWorld</h2>

<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2046306/how-to-find-a-lost-message-in-gmail.html#tk.rss_howto">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2046306/how-to-find-a-lost-message-in-gmail.htmlo</a>



Chances are that you simply misplaced the messages, moving them to another label by mistake. If that's the case, finding them shouldn't be too difficult.

<h2> Install any version of Windows using any Windows disc you can find | PCWorld</h2>

<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2044281/install-any-version-of-windows-using-any-windows-disc-you-can-find.html">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2044281/install-any-version-of-windows-using-any-windows-disc-you-can-find.html</a>



You need to reinstall Windows and you never had recovery discs to begin with. Few manufacturers provide them anymore, and many new PCs don't have optical drives even if they did.



Thankfully, there's a way around this. All you need is a Windows ISO file (basically the entire Windows operating system in a single container) and the free Ei.cfg Removal Utility. The latter deletes a key file inside the former, thus allowing you to install any version of Windows.

<h2>How to download streaming media and watch it anywhere, anytime | PCWorld</h2>

Watching a movie or burning through episodes of your favorite TV show is the best way to get through a long plane trip, a car ride, or a vacation in the middle of nowhere.



Luckily, you can use third-party software and a few tricks to download streaming video from Amazon, Hulu, and Netflix. Now you can watch your entertainment on your terms, even in places where your cherished Amazon Prime account is inaccessible.

<h2> Firefox: How to change the default page format (to A4)<em>

<dl><dt><a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/10078822365635360301">Martin Wildam</a> said...</dt></dl>Here is how to change it (to A4 in my case):

<ul>

	<li>In the location bar enter: "about:config"</li>

	<li>Read carefully and confirm that you are going to be careful</li>

	<li>Be careful with the following steps!</li>

	<li>In the search bar enter "paper"</li>

	<li>Look for properties ending with paper_size and paper_name.</li>

	<li>For me it was sufficient to change "print.postscript.paper_size" and "print.print_paper_name" to "A4".</li>

</ul>

There might be some additional properties ending with paper_size and paper_name for each of your available printers. I didn't touch them and it worked anyway – YMMV.



print.postscript.paper_size needs to be changed to A4 now too in Thunderbird.



<em>In my version it seems to be changed to iso_A4 not A4 - Roderick</em>

Need to lose weight, quit smoking, improve your sex life or get a better night’s sleep? There’s an app for that — all of it — and more. Thousands of mobile apps are available to improve your health and fitness.



MapMyFitness offers a group of exercise sites and apps including the popular MapMyRun. The company has developed a detailed privacy policy explaining how user information is used.



But beware.



Health apps can provide information and motivation to help you manage your well-being, and they’re easy to use and often free. But they may not have protecting your privacy as a priority.

With up to 100GB of storage on the new discs, Singulus' BLULINE III is able to print a 4K movie onto to a single triple layer Blu-ray disc. 4K content will be available digitally through services like Netflix and Sony Video Unlimited, but considering the size of these files, discs will likely still be a viable format.

Microsoft is pursuing the ideal of OS platforms: a unified code base that runs from smartphones to servers, giving users a consistent experience across devices at home and at work, and developers a common tool set for building applications.



"We really should have one silicon interface for all of our devices. We should have one set of developer APIs on all of our devices," said Terry Myerson, executive vice president of Microsoft's Operating Systems Engineering Group, during the company's meeting with financial analysts on Thursday.



"And all of the apps we bring to end users should be available on all of our devices," he added.

<h2> What APIs Are And Why They're Important – ReadWrite</h2>

<a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/09/19/api-defined?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+readwriteweb+%28ReadWriteWeb%29">http://readwrite.com/2013/09/19/api-defined?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+readwriteweb+%28ReadWriteWeb%29</a>



What are APIs, and why do we care so much about them?



In the simplest terms, APIs are sets of requirements that govern how one application can talk to another. APIs aren't at all new; whenever you use a desktop or laptop, APIs are what make it possible to move information between programs—for instance, by cutting and pasting a snippet of a LibreOffice document into an Excel spreadsheet. System-level APIs makes it possible for applications like LibreOffice to run on top of an OS like Windows in the first place.



On the Web, APIs make it possible for big services like Google Maps or Facebook to let other apps "piggyback" on their offerings. Think about the way Yelp, for instance, displays nearby restaurants on a Google Map in its app, or the way some video games now let players chat, post high scores and invite friends to play via Facebook, right there in the middle of a game.

<h2> Understanding Encryption: Here's The Key – ReadWrite</h2>

Here's why encryption matters, how it's facing more threats than ever, and what we can do about it.



Unsafe At Any Computing Speed



The most recent set of documents, now being released piecemeal by Snowden's media contacts across the world, seem to indicate that the U.S.'s NSA has somehow managed to render encryption, a tool used to obfuscate data and text, completely worthless.



But it turns out that while the NSA may have compromised some specific technical standards for encryption, the larger notion of encryption, properly implemented, remains valid.
