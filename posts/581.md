AddThis: Tracking your browser everywhere

AddThis is a simple tool allowing webmasters to put share buttons on their pages.

However, they're more nefarious than they appear, tracking peoples browsing habits.

their prevalence is actually shocking, when you install a tool called 'Ghostery' you can see just how many sites have the technology embedded.

they can do this even with cookies disabled, but using javascript to 'draw' an image which is then md5'd and used to fingerprint you and your browser.

<h2>Meet the Online Tracking Device That is Virtually Impossible to Block</h2>

A new kind of tracking tool, canvas fingerprinting, is being used to follow visitors to thousands of top websites, from WhiteHouse.gov to YouPorn.

Update: After this article was published, YouPorn contacted us to say it had removed AddThis technology from its website, saying that the website was "completely unaware that AddThis contained a tracking software that had the potential to jeopardize the privacy of our users." A spokeswoman for the German digital marketer Ligatus also said that is no longer running its test of canvas fingerprinting, and that it has no plans to use it in the future.

The researchers found canvas fingerprinting computer code, primarily written by a company called AddThis, on 5 percent of the top 100,000 websites. Most of the code was on websites that use AddThis social media sharing tools. Other fingerprinters include the German digital marketer Ligatus and the Canadian dating site Plentyoffish.

<h2>Google wants to tell you how it's tracking you with updated privacy settings</h2>

Google's new, easier to understand privacy controls break down which of its services are gathering information about you.

Google is making its privacy controls easier to find and understand in an attempt to make the more than 1 billion users of its digital services more comfortable about the personal information that they give the Internet's most powerful company.

The simpler approach debuting today features a redesigned My Account hub where all of Google's key privacy controls can be found. Accountholders can also undergo a check-up that will break down which of the company's various services are gathering information about them.

A new site at privacy.google.com will also address a variety of issues in a question-and-answer format.

How often do you check your privacy settings?

<h2>Microsoft issues new Windows, Skype and online privacy rules</h2>

Microsoft is taking a lead from Google that unified its policies in 2012.

The firm tackles transparency in a range of ways, including transparency reports and calling for US data privacy reforms.

Microsoft is currently engaged in a legal battle with the US over held data held in Ireland.

Gutiérrez said that the new Privacy Statement offers a balance between simplicity and service level type information.

Privacy information is short and to the point, and Microsoft said that it does not exploit customer information for advertising purposes and leaves the control of information to the individual.

<h2>NOT OK, Google! Privacy advocates take on the Chromium team and win...</h2>

The contested behaviour in Chromium boiled down to this:

Install Chromium (the reporter was using OS X but Chromium builds on Windows and Linux too, amongst others).

Run it.

Watch it download a binary BLOB (non-open-source lump of executable code).

Find out that the BLOB is responsible for listening to your microphone in case you say, "OK, Google."

The incantation "OK, Google" is Mountain View's trigger phrase (hotword, as it is somewhat inaccurately called) to turn on voice commands, to save you typing.

Not OK, Google

Open-source privacy advocates rather convincingly argued that this behaviour is not the sort of thing you'd expect from an open project.

Firstly, there's the issue of automatically downloading an add-in module that you didn't build yourself, without being asked, and without knowing what it's for.

Secondly, there's the issue of code that turns on your microphone without asking you first.

Thirdly, the privacy guys quickly noticed, there's the problem that the add-in module doesn't show up in Chromium's add-in list.

Anyway, after getting on its high horse for a bit, Google's Chromium project climbed down onto a pony.

And after a couple of days on the pony, the Chromium guys capitulated completely, just four hours ago:

In light of this issue, we have decided to remove the hotwording component entirely from Chromium. As it is not open source, it does not belong in the open source browser.</body></html>
