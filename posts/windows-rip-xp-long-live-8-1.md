Microsoft on Wednesday revealed plans to make Windows free for manufacturers to use on smartphones and tablets with screen sizes under nine inches. Furthermore, a future version of Windows for the Internet of Things will also be completely free – moves that will no doubt help the Redmond-based company better compete with Android and increase market share in the red-hot mobile sector.

From now through June 15, XP users looking to move to a new system are eligible for a $100 discount on a qualifying machine priced at $599 or higher. A Microsoft rep said the deal will only show up for those who visit the Microsoft Store via a Windows XP machine in a clear nod to make sure that only XP users receive the savings.



Users that prefer to shop via brick and mortar can physically bring their XP machine to one of over 80 retail Microsoft stores across the country as proof of eligibility.



In addition to the $100 savings, buyers will also qualify for 90 days of free support and free data transfer. The data migration tool from Laplink was announced earlier this month and is available to all users free of charge from Microsoft's website.

<h2>Windows XP is finally DEAD, right? Er, not quite.</h2>

Here's what to do if you're stuck with it

Lock down and look sharp, it's the hackers' game now

Today will be like no other day because it’s the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/04/04/final_winxp_patch_tuesday_pre_alert/" target="_blank">last Patch Tuesday for Windows XP</a>. Yet there's good news if you're still using XP. For starters, you're not alone.



How do you protect yourself? Here’s some recommendations:

<ul>

	<li>Edit your PC’s Windows registry so Office and media components don't play or execute programs by default</li>

	<li>Limit user rights to restrict things like browsing and email and also restrict the PC to run only “known good” apps</li>

	<li>Control access to removable media and devices like smart phones, so viruses and other malware isn't transported from machine to machine</li>

	<li>Convert Windows XP machines into thin clients or virtualize the desktop</li>

	<li>Create controlled zones of Windows XP machines, filtered via internet gateways to control inbound traffic as authorised</li>

	<li>Apply all latest patches to the apps you’re running – and to Windows XP itself</li>

	<li>Only run the latest versions of software such as Java and Flash</li>

	<li>Install the latest anti-virus and anti-malware products from third parties onto your PCs</li>

	<li>If you have upgraded, double check whether partner, customer or supplier connections to your network or PCs are using Windows XP</li>

	<li>Move critical applications and users to server-based computing</li>

</ul>

In an attempt to lure people off its 13-year-old Windows XP operating system, Microsoft will pay $100 to XP users who upgrade to a new Windows 8 PC.



The promotion, run via the Microsoft Store website, is open to users who ditch their Windows XP systems and buy new machines.



The money-off offer applies to PCs costing $699 or more that are bought from Redmond's online shop. The deal – which throws in 90 days of tech support and a download of software to migrate files all for free – will run through 15 June, nine weeks after official support for Windows XP is set to expire on April 8.
